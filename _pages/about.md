<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm an undergraduate student majoring computer science at Duke Kunshan University. I am recently collaborating with Prof. [Meng Guo (ÂõΩËêå)](https://mengguo.github.io/personal_site/) and his team, especially Dr. [Junfeng Chen (Èôà‰øäÈîã)](https://junfengchen-robotics.github.io/) from Peking University. I am a member of [Edge Intelligence Lab](https://sites.duke.edu/edgeintelligence/) supervised by Prof. [Bing Luo (ÁΩóÂÜ∞)](https://luobing1008.github.io/index.html).

My research interests focus on adaptive coordination and communication in multi-robot systems, particularly under challenging conditions such as intermittent connectivity, limited communication, and unknown environments. I specialize in developing frameworks that optimize task planning, dynamic allocation, and communication strategies for heterogeneous robotic fleets (e.g., UAVs/UGVs) using LLM, optimization, and tree-search algorithms. My work emphasizes creating robust, scalable, and explainable solutions for real-world applications, including large-scale 3D exploration, inspection, and interaction. Through high-fidelity simulations and innovative algorithmic designs, I aim to address practical challenges in dynamic scenarios while ensuring reliable system performance.

[LLMs Meet Formal Methods for Robot Swarms: Reliable, Explainable and Efficient Human-in-the-loop Planning in Unknown Environments](https://www.science.org/journal/scirobotics)

Junfeng Chen, **Yuxiao Zhu**, An Zhuo, Xintong Zhang, Shuo Zhang, Meng Guo, and Zhongkui Li.

[**Video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwQUosh9Kds&feature=youtu.be) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- We propose a formal method and LLM framework for coordinating large fleets of heterogeneous robots in open and dynamic environments. Our approach integrates model-checking-based task planning with LLM-powered reasoning and interaction, ensuring adaptability, explainability, and optimal mission execution. Validated through simulations and real-world deployments, it proves effective for disaster response, infrastructure inspection, and dynamic surveillance.

[CoCoPlan: Adaptive Coordination and Communication for Multi-robot Systems in Dynamic and Unknown Environments](https://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/ra-l/submission-procedures)

Xintong Zhang, Junfeng Chen, **Yuxiao Zhu**, and Meng Guo

[**Project**](https://junfengchen-robotics.github.io/SLEI3D/) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- We propose CoCoPlan, a unified framework that co-optimizes collaborative task planning and intermittent communication for multi-robot systems. Our approach integrates the branch-and-bound task encoding, adaptive efficiency objectives, and optimized event scheduling to handle dynamic environments under limited connectivity in both office and disaster-response scenarios.

[SLEI3D: Simultaneous Exploration and Inspection via Heterogeneous Fleets under Limited Communication](https://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/t-ase/information-for-authors-t-ase)

Junfeng Chen, **Yuxiao Zhu**, Xintong Zhang, and Meng Guo

[**Project**](https://junfengchen-robotics.github.io/SLEI3D/) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- We propose SLEI3D, a planning and coordination framework for heterogeneous multi-robot systems to perform simultaneous 3D exploration, inspection, and real-time reporting in unknown environments. Our approach integrates adaptive inspection and intermittent communication protocols with a multi-layer, multi-rate planning mechanism for robust coordination.
