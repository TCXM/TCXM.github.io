abstract: We propose CoCoPlan, a unified framework that co-optimizes collaborative task planning and intermittent communication for multi-robot systems. Our approach integrates the branch-and-bound task encoding, adaptive efficiency objectives, and optimized event scheduling to handle dynamic environments under limited connectivity in both office and disaster-response scenarios.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
