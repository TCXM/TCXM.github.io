abstract: We propose SLEI3D, a planning and coordination framework for heterogeneous multi-robot systems to perform simultaneous 3D exploration, inspection, and real-time reporting in unknown environments. Our approach integrates adaptive inspection and intermittent communication protocols with a multi-layer, multi-rate planning mechanism for robust coordination.
