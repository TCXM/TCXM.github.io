abstract: We propose DEXTER-LLM, a novel framework for dynamic task planning in unknown environments. Our approach integrates LLM-based multi-stage reasoning, optimization-based task assignment, and adaptive human-in-the-loop verification to tackle the challenges of online adaptability and explainability.
