title: "DEXTER-LLM: Dynamic and Explainable Coordination of Multi-Robot Systems in Unknown Environments Via Large Language Models"

event: IROS 2025 Conference
event_url: https://iros25.org/

location: Hangzhou International Expo Center (HIEC)
address:
  street: 353 Benjing Avenue
  city: Hangzhou
  region: Zhejiang
  country: China

summary: We propose DEXTER-LLM, a novel framework for dynamic task planning in unknown environments. Our approach integrates LLM-based multi-stage reasoning, optimization-based task assignment, and adaptive human-in-the-loop verification to tackle the challenges of online adaptability and explainability.

> Click on the **Slides** button above to view the built-in slides feature.

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Hugo Blox Builder's [_Slides_](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/content-types/) feature and link using the `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to this page bundle and link it using `links: [{ type: slides, url: path/to/file } ]` in front matter
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/markdown/).

Further event details, including [page elements](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/markdown/) such as image galleries, can be added to the body of this page. -->
